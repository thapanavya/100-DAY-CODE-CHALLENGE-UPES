//Write a Program to take a positive integer n as input, and find the pivot integer x such that the sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively. Print the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, print -1. Assume that it is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot integer for the given input.

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int total = n * (n + 1) / 2;

    for(int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        int left = x * (x + 1) / 2;
        int right = total - (x - 1) * x / 2;
        if(left == right) {
